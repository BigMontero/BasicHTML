    <p>Orange fruits are a vibrant and tasty group that belong to various families of plants. When people think of “orange fruits,”
       they often think of the citrus family, but the term can also encompass fruits that are naturally orange in color,
       even if they do not belong to the citrus genus. Probably the most well-known orange fruit. Oranges are sweet, juicy, and packed with vitamin C.
       There are different varieties, including navel oranges, blood oranges, and Valencia oranges. They're perfect for juicing or eating fresh.</p>
    <h2 align="center">Strawberry</h2>

    <p>Strawberries are one of the most beloved fruits in the world, famous for their sweet, juicy flavor,
       vibrant red color, and heart-shaped appearance. Strawberries are technically not true berries from a botanical standpoint.
       Instead, they are an "aggregate fruit," meaning they develop from multiple ovaries of a single flower. The red fleshy part that we eat is
       actually the swollen receptacle, and the small seeds on the outside are the actual fruit (called achenes).</p>
    <h2 align="center">Apple</h2>

    <p>Apples are one of the most widely cultivated and beloved fruits in the world, cherished for their versatility,
       crisp texture, and delicious sweetness (or tartness). They belong to the Rosaceae family, which also includes pears,
       peaches, and cherries. Apples are the fruit of the apple tree (Malus domestica) and come in a range of colors, including red,
       green, yellow, and bi-colored varieties. The flesh of an apple is typically crunchy and juicy, with a flavor that can range from sweet to tart,
       depending on the variety.</p>
