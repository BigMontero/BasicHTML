    <p>I am glad to write to you this letter. I have come across a lot of adverts about this great institution and it will be a great honor to work with your company as a software programmer.
        I have years of experience in this field and l am going to deliver as i am to do. I hope my letter is convencing enough to be accepted as your software programmer.
        Thank you and have a nice week.
